# Eclipse Techboard

It's here: [Manfranmike.github.io](https://manfranmike.github.io/)

This is a digital techboard I made over two weekends to use while playing Eclipse 1E. I've included some optional 2E settings, in case you're playing 2E or 1.5E. I can't promise it'll work with 2E exactly, as I use 1E.

I can't promise there will be any more updates to this tool as it currently works well enough for my needs. My group needed a way to see the techs and pass it around without throwing tiles around. I load this up on a small tablet, and it works perfectly. Any other device (even fullscreen on PC) won't be as responsive and may look funky.

If you find any issues or have suggestions, feel free to add them to this repo or even fork it to make some changes yourself.

## How to use

1. Go to [Manfranmike.github.io](https://manfranmike.github.io/)
1. Select options you need and hit "Start Round 1"
  2. If Predictable Technologies was selected, you need to press the Next Round button at the bottom to draw the first tiles.
3. Tap/Click on a technology with a quantity over zero to purchase it
4. Tap/Blick the ">>" Next Round button to draw new tiles based on player count.

## Features
- All 1E base and expansion techs
- 4 techs added in 2E
- Player count selection
- Toggleable expansions
- Toggleable Predictable Technologies variant
- Toggleable 2E base costs
- Purchase techs to reduce count
- Weighted randoms for drawing tiles based on quantity included in 1E

## To-Do
None of these are guaranteed to happen, but if I come back to the project, then these are getting developed first:

- Undo feature for misclicked purchases
- Show description of tech before purchase
- Better responsiveness on more screen sizes
- Better looking confirm toasts
- Remove W3.CSS crutch
